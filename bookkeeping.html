      <h1><strong>Bookkeeping Made Simple (and Fast)</strong></h1>
      <p class="lead"><strong>How I Can Get Your Books Clean in Hours, Not Weeks</strong></p>

      <p>If you run a business, you know how important it is to keep your tools, equipment, and crew in good shape. Your books are no different — they’re the tools that show you where your money’s going and how much you’re really making.</p>

      <p><strong>When your books are clean and up to date, you can:</strong></p>
      <ul>
        <li>Spot extra income you might have missed.</li>
        <li>See where you’re overspending.</li>
        <li>Make smarter choices about jobs, hiring, and equipment.</li>
        <li>Be ready for taxes without the last-minute scramble.</li>
      </ul>

      <div class="section">
        <h2><strong>The Problem with Bookkeeping the Old Way</strong></h2>
        <p>Most bookkeeping is slow, costly, and a pain to deal with. Someone goes through every transaction by hand, month after month. That means:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>It takes forever to catch up when you’re behind.</li>
          <li>It costs more than it should.</li>
          <li>Mistakes happen because humans make errors.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>A lot of business owners only keep books “good enough” to file taxes. That’s like patching a leaky pipe or ignoring a warning light — it works for a while, but it’s not giving you the full picture.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="section">
        <h2><strong>How I Do It Differently</strong></h2>
        <p>I’ve built an automated bookkeeping system that can go through years of your transactions in just a few hours. Here’s how it works:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>I get access to your QuickBooks account, and your QuickBooks must be connected to your bank accounts.</li>
          <li>My system automatically sorts and categorizes everything with 95%+ accuracy.</li>
          <li>I personally review and double-check the work before handing you clean, ready-to-use books.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>No endless waiting. No massive bills for manual data entry. Just quick, accurate results.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="section">
        <h2><strong>Why It Matters</strong></h2>
        <p>Once your books are cleaned up, you’ll be able to:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Keep more of your money by spotting write-offs and avoiding overpaying on taxes.</li>
          <li>See exactly which products, jobs, or services make you the most profit.</li>
          <li>Hand lenders or investors professional, accurate numbers if you ever need financing.</li>
        </ul>
      </div>

      <div class="section">
        <h2><strong>Let’s Get You Caught Up</strong></h2>
        <p>If your books are a mess — or you’ve been putting them off — I can get you caught up fast. You’ll have clear numbers you can trust, without weeks of back-and-forth.</p>
