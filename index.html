    <h2>About the Owner-Operator</h2>
    <img src="Profile_Pic.jpg" alt="Varun Suresh" class="profile-pic" />
    <p>
      Hi, I’m Varun Suresh — the founder of Atlas Bookkeeping.
      Before starting this firm, I worked as an investment advisor in the small business M&A space. One of the biggest issues I saw was that business owners often had messy or incomplete books — and that meant their businesses were undervalued when it came time to sell.
    </p>
    <p>
      I transitioned from advising to accounting so I could help business owners where it really counts: the numbers. 
    </p>
    <p>
      I’m a CPA candidate with a Masters in Accounting and QuickBooks ProAdvisor certification, specializing in bookkeeping and tax optimization for service businesses. I help owners reduce their tax bill, stay audit-proof, and make better decisions with clean, accurate books. I’m currently taking on just one or two more clients so I can devote focused attention to delivering exceptional results. If you're looking for someone who understands how proper bookkeeping directly impacts your taxes and bottom line, let’s talk.
