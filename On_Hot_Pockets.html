    <p>I’ve learned a lot about money..</p>

    <p>In the past, I trained in skills that could have been used for the wrong kind of transactions. I didn’t get far, but I learned something important: it feels a lot better when both sides of a deal can shake hands, look each other in the eye, and say, “Thank you.”</p>

    <p>That’s the way I work now. Win-win. No games, no one-sided wins, just mutual benefit.</p>

    <p>In India, there’s a phrase — “Hot Pockets” — that means wealth and freedom. I wish hot pockets for my clients, because their success is mine.</p>

    <p>As an accountant-in-training, my promise is simple:</p>

    <ul>
        <li>• <b>Quarterly meetings</b> where I explain your financials in plain language.</li>
        <li>• <b>Clean, accurate books</b> so you know where you stand at all times.</li>
        <li>• <b>Loyalty and discretion</b>, because your business is your livelihood — and your privacy matters.</li>
        <li>• <b>Action over words</b>, proven by results.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>I believe in loyalty, gratitude, and making sure my clients feel stronger and more secure after working with me. If we do this right, we both walk away richer — not just in money, but in trust. The results I deliver to you will exemplify these values.</p>

    <p><b>I wish you hot pockets.</b></p>
