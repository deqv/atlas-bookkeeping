  <h1>Mergers and Acquisitions Reality: What Home Service Business Owners Should Know</h1>

  <p>You don’t need to be a $10 million business to sell. If you own a plumbing, HVAC, electrical, or similar service company and you're earning solid profits, buyers are still looking for businesses like yours—even in today’s economy.</p>

  <h2>Yes, Buyers Are Still Out There</h2>
  <p>While larger deals are being delayed or canceled due to economic volatility, trade policy uncertainty, regulatory shifts, and rising interest rates, this doesn’t apply to most small service businesses.</p>

  <h2>Why Your Business Is Still in Demand</h2>
  <p>There’s over $1.2 trillion in private equity and acquisition capital waiting to be invested. A growing share is targeting recession-resistant, profitable businesses making $300K to $1.5M in EBITDA—especially in trades like plumbing, HVAC, and electrical.</p>
  <p>These businesses are attractive because they:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Provide essential services people can’t delay</li>
    <li>Can grow with better systems and staff</li>
    <li>Fit easily into larger business rollups</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>The $36 Million Payday: Real, But Conditional</h2>
  <p>A well-known investor once said: “If a business makes $4 million in EBITDA, it can sell for $32–36 million.” That’s true—but only if it meets strict criteria.</p>
  <p>High multiples (8–9x) go to companies that:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Have clean financials and clear internal processes</li>
    <li>Generate repeatable revenue</li>
    <li>Run with low owner involvement</li>
    <li>Maintain strong margins and scalable systems</li>
    <li>Fit a strategic buyer’s acquisition model</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>What You Should Be Doing Now</h2>
  <p>Even if you’re not planning to sell soon, you should prepare like you might. Well-run businesses are worth more—on paper and in practice.</p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Get your books in order:</strong> Organized financials build buyer confidence.</li>
    <li><strong>Reduce owner dependence:</strong> If the business needs you daily, it's less attractive.</li>
    <li><strong>Document your systems:</strong> Show buyers how your business runs.</li>
    <li><strong>Know your buyer:</strong> Different buyers value different things.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Final Thought</h2>
  <p>The broader M&A slowdown doesn’t apply to profitable home service businesses. If your operation is dialed in—and your books can prove it—serious buyers are still out there.</p>
  <p>The window belongs to the prepared—not the hopeful.</p>
